# Algorithms Explained
The word Algorithm means ***"A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations"*** Or ***"A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations"***. Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.

## Sorting
Each sorting algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, so the best algorithm to use will depend on the specific data set and the requirements of the application.

## Big O of Sorting
- Bubble sort: O(n^2)
- Selection sort: O(n^2)
- Insertion sort: O(n^2)
- Merge sort: O(n log n)
- Quick sort: O(n log n)
- Heap sort: O(n log n)
