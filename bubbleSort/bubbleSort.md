### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in an array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm continues until no more swaps are necessary, which means that the array is sorted.

## Pseudocode

## Big O Complexity
- Time Complexity
    - best case O(*n*^<sup>2</sup>)
    - average case O(*n*^<sup>2</sup>)
    - worst case O(*n*^<sup>2</sup>)
- Space Complexity
    - O(1)
