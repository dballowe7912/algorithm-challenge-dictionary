``Functional programming`` is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.

To use functional programming with JavaScript, you can use the following techniques:

- Use higher-order functions: Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
- Use immutable data: Immutable data is data that cannot be changed once it is created.
- Use recursion: Recursion is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller problems of the same type.
- Use lazy evaluation: Lazy evaluation is a technique for evaluating expressions only when they are needed.

``Functional programming`` can be a powerful tool for writing JavaScript code that is more concise, elegant, and reusable.
