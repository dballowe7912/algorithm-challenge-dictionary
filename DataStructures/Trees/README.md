# TREES
A data structure that consists of Nodes in a **parent / child** relationship.
Lists are linear meaning *one path*, while Trees are nonlinear *multiple paths*.

- `root` is the top node in a tree
- `child` is a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- `parent` is the converse notion of a child
- `siblings` a group of nodes with the same parent
- `leaf` a node with no children
- `edge` is the connection between one node and another

## Binary Tree
A data structure with one root node, which has a value and at most 2 children nodes, usually called left child and right child. Each child has one parent, and a node with no child is called a leaf node.

## Binary Search Trees
- Every parent node has at most 2 children
- Every node to the left of the parent is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of the parent is always greater than the parent
