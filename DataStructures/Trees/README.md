# TREES
A data structure that consists of Nodes in a **parent / child** relationship.
Lists are linear meaning *one path*, while Trees are nonlinear *multiple paths*.

- **Root** is the top node in a tree
- **Child** is a Node directly connected to another Node when moving away from the root
- **Parent** is the converse notion of a child
- **Siblings** a group of Nodes with the same parent
- **Leaf** a Node with no children
- **Edge** is the connection between one node and another

## Binary Search Trees
- Every parent Node has at most 2 children
- Every Node to the left of the parent is always less than the parent
- Every Node to the right of the parent is always greater than the parent
