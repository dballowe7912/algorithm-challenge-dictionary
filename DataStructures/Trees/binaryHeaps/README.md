### Binary Heaps
Very similar to a Binary Search Tree, but with different rules.
In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.

## Max Binary Heap
- Each parent has at most 2 child nodes
- The value of each parent node is **always** greater than its child nodes
- In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes
- A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
