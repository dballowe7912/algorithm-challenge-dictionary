# Selection Sort
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element in an unsorted array and swapping it with the first element of the array. The algorithm continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Pseudocode
- Store the first element as the smallest value
- Compare that element to the next, until you find one smaller
- If smaller is found, designate as new minimum element and continue to the end of array
- If the minimum is not the value you began with, swap the two values
- Repeat with the next element until array is sorted

## Big O Complexity
- Worst case O(n^2)
